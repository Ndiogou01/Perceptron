# Perceptron
The Perceptron project is an application designed to predict flower types using a perceptron model. This project aims to demonstrate the use of machine learning algorithms to classify flowers based on their features. The application utilizes a simple perceptron model trained to categorize flowers into different types based on measurements such as sepal length and petal length.
